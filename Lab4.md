This page will show the steps used to complete the tasks assigned to us.

The second step was to fork the repository that will be used later on. After forking, your repository page should look similar to this:

## Step 3
The third step is to start a timer to test yourself. In my case, I used the timer on my phone, but any timer can be used.
## Step 4
The fourth step is to login to ieng6 with my course specific account. Since I completed to setup for my personal device, I dont have to type in my password while logging in. Since I had previously logged in, the process was also simplified by using my arrow keys to access my bash history. The commands I used were `<up><enter>`.That process looks like this:

## Step 5
The fifth step was to clone my fork of the repository that was given to us earlier. Since I had previoulsy ran the command necessary, I was able to save time by using the following command `<up><up><up><up><enter>`. That process looked something like this:
